## Overview

### SHA-512

SHA-512 is a hash function that helps encode important and sensitive data, like passwords, by turning input into hash digests. These hash digests have a fixed length. In the case of SHA-512, a 512-bit hash is created; compared to its predecessor SHA-256 which only creates hashes of 256 bits, SHA-512 is more secure. Designed by the NSA (National Security Agency), it was published in 2002. 

### Algorithm

1. Data is inputted. SHA-512 aims to turn this input into an output, the hash digest, of fixed length (512 bits). This hash digest needs to be uniformly distributed. If there is a fixed length, it is certain that there will be duplicate hash digests for certain different inputs. Uniform distribution ensures that each possible output value is equally likely given an input. Strong collision resistance is also important; it should not be feasible to find more than one input that results in the same hash digest.
