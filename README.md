## Overview

### SHA-512

SHA-512 is a hash function that helps encode important and sensitive data, like passwords, by turning input into hash digests. These hash digests have a fixed length. In the case of SHA-512, a 512-bit hash is created; compared to its predecessor SHA-256 which only creates hashes of 256 bits, SHA-512 is more secure.
