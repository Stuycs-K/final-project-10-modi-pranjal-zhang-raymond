### 5/22/24

- Created a git branch 'pmodi'.
- Continued looking into previous deployments of the SHA-256 algorithm as an example for SHA-512 implementations.

### 5/23/24

- Created a 'src' folder to hold all of the code (for now, a helper file and the main file, both in Python).
- Coded some helper functions regarding bitstrings, message padding, and zeros padding into the helper file.
- Finished entire message padding functionality (preparation of message *mainly* done).

### 5/24/24

- Implemented a binary adder, which has an implemented carry-in bit, of two bitstrings of the same length.
- Added some elementary bitstring manipulation operations, including right and left-rotation.
- Planned a bit ahead as to integration of these helper functions into the main algorithm.
